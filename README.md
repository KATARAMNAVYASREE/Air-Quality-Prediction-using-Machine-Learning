Air pollution is one of the most pressing environmental challenges today, directly affecting human health, climate, and ecosystems. This project harnesses the power of machine learning to predict air quality levels based on historical pollutant data.

This repository demonstrates how supervised learning algorithms can forecast air quality using datasets that contain features like:

-> PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, and O₃ concentrations.

->Meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

->Timestamped measurements for building time-based models.

By training predictive models on past environmental data, we can:

-> Provide early warnings for poor air quality

-> Support timely public health advisories

-> Help governments and agencies make data-driven decisions

Machine Learning Models Used:

-> Linear Regression

-> Decision Tree

-> Random Forest

-> Support Vector Machine (SVM)

-> Neural Networks (optional for extended analysis)
